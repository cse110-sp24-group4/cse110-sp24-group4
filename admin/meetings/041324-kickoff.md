- Communicate with other team members
- Make every effort to show up to team events
- Start early

Daniel also presented the following guidelines as a basis for the team's programming practices:

- Follow programming best practices (i.e. descriptive defintions, functions that perfom only their described task, etc.)
- As the project moves along one or two people will control push requests to avoid chaos
- Ask for help if needed
- More specific guidelines to be provided and agreed upon based on project type/content

### Team Intro Video Ideas
Kaye and Matt were appointed to handle the team video editing. The team discussed ideas for the video. The first idea was to have the team in the tree and point the camera at each team member as they introduce themselves. The team was unable to find a suiteable tree so settled for using the elevator in the Hopkins Parking structure with a team member on each level.

### Github Organization
Members were informed of the GitHub organization and sent their GitHub IDs to Daniel who created the organization and added all team members.

### Project Ideas
Some project ideas that Shang had were presented by Daniel. One being a website for an online game he designed and another being a learning-focused site for Go, utilizing AI.
