### Team Member Check In
- Some concerns:
    - Barely any styling within the project page.
 
#### Timeline Check In
- Talking about needing better communication between team members and the team leads.
    - Should let them know when we can't push something/we're behind/etc.
 
### Functionality
- To Do List
- Notes should have the ability to have tags added to them + filtering.
    - No actual tech spec. for that just yet &rarr; should work with team leads or come up with the spec yourself.
    - specs page - shows a feature complete note page.
        - To Do List:
        - Notes:
            - Title, Date at Top.
            - Preview Text - for really long note
            - Details Tag (HTML) for text
                - If details is open, preview text is hidden.
                - If details is closed, preview text is shown.
            - Edit Button: Edit title and text content.
            - Sort by date.
            - Functionality for this portion should get done by the **end of this week.**
- Possible Gamification - can still happen

### UI Clarification
- Cut the features to be displayed by date for the notes.
- Verticle grid with one block - better for longer notes.
- So UI render is a guide but will be adjusted as we keep going.
- Updated UI presented during the meeting too.

### Issues
- Screen Sizing for the Project Page.
- Calendar Functionality:
    - Displaying notes by a specific date / due dates for tasks.

### Additional Topics
- Next week should be focused on testing.
- Due Dates/Calendar view would be secondary tasks.
    - Option to pick a date &rarr; brings you to a notes page for that specific date.
        - List the notes based off of date
        - Option to switch dates
        - To Do List / Due Dates
