### Topics


- Successes and failures this week
- What processes worked? What didn't? What is our focus moving forward?

### Successes and Weaknesses

#### Successes
- Been moving a lot quicker than before, mainly due to having the issues on the Project on the Github page laid out properly.
- Everyone knows what they're doing on the project, and assigning themselves to the issues is good so there's no lack of direction individually.


#### Weaknesses
- Communication between the teams is not as good as it could be , but it has been better than before.
- As a whole it's harder to see what everyone else is doing on the project.

### Focus Moving Forward
- Not allowed to put any more code in by Friday or Saturday + Have an update video due on that day.
- Should try to get most of the issues to be merged into the dev branch by Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.
- That way the team can spend a couple days making sure everything is clean.
    - Deleting branches that aren't in use.
    - README.md needs to be updated 
- Gamification can try to be worked on within a couple of days.
- Generally try to finish what we have now.
- Clean everything up and add some more tests.
- Final Interviews: have to be scheduled with Akhshay.
    - Should have an understanding of what other people have been doing.
    - Stuff like:
        - Can you explain how the pipeline works?
        - Do you need a review to merge things into the branch?
        - What did you do in the very first sprint?
