### Project Overview
We are making 2 calendars generally with the 2 different subteams and comparing which method we prefer. After weighing the pros and cons of each approach.

### General Brainstorming on Miro
AI: Worked on the Calendar UI where it displays the month and days. Once you click on the day, there is a pop up page of a hourly scheduler. 

Non-AI: Brainstormed consumers that may use the app. We might have to pick one of them and tailor the app to them.

### Unfinshed Business
- Need to figure out how to store user data
