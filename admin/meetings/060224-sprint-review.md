### Review Videos
- Need two review videos &rarr; Daniel should have uploaded one.

### Show and Tell
- All the team members show what they've been doing during the past week.
- UI Team:
    - Split off in different parts that we're going to fix.
    - Kaye: Home screen shifted to match the Figma design.
    - Anushka: Notes page changed so that the notes are in a grid format.
        - Date and Title should go below the title.
        - Add Completed Tasks button still needs to be implemented.
    - Tia: Project page, the all notes functionality is almost completed so CSS will be completed shortly after that.
- Vaibhav: Gamification:
    - Technically still have time but can't be a big undertaking.
    - Should be a small thing.
- Kekoa: Add completed tasks to notes has been worked on, but end to end tests still have to be made in order to be sure.
- Joseph: Animations for adding and deleting notes has been made, as well as expanding the notes.
    - PWA has been implemented
- Gautham: Graceful Degredation &rarr; when javascript is disabled there's minimal functionality with the website, so there's a warning for javascript to be turned on for multiple devices.
    - Collapsible Todo List
- Matt: Projects Page addition where you can view notes by date. Some edits need to be made for bugs, but it should be good sometime soon.
