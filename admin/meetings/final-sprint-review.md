### Topics

- App demo
- Recognition of contributions
- SWOT

## App Demo
- Daniel showed the app via the website and the PWA portion.

## Recognition
- Daniel went through and recognized the contribution for each of the team members.
- Everyone was really present and contributing on things, so it was a good experience all around.

## SWOT

### Strengths
- Fairly lightweight &rarr; loads very quickly and its very responsive
- Simplicity &rarr; its easy to navigate, so we did a good job in managing scope of the project.
- PWA &rarr; helps with app usage across different platforms.

### Weaknesses
- Looks a little clunky on mobile &rarr; overall its good, but there's an odd thing with the sizing of texts that makes it zoom in.
- Functionally it works but the styling is strange &rarr; collapsible list on mobile could've used more styling.
- Lack of consistency &rarr; clicking on the "Add New Project" Button to add the new project, but then clicking on the folder to go to the project page.

### Opportunities
- Work on getting actual user perspectives on the app.
- Implementing the gamification &rarr; as a user, they would've wanted a dog and there aren't any dogs in the app.

### Threats
- The app isn't very unique &rarr; gamification might've made the project more unique.
    - If we had one more week then we could've gotten that working.
