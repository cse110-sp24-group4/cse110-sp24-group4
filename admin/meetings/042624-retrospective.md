### Topics

- Successes and failures for warmup project
- What processes worked? What didn't? What is our focus moving forward?

### Successes and Weaknesses

#### Successes

- Having the right prompts for AI gave some speed to the process of making the code for the project.
- Using AI to help obtain prompts for Javascript minimized the amount of time it would take to learn/familiarize ourselves with the content.
- AI assists in the functionality and it's easy to see how the logic makes sense.
  - AI is also helpful to integrate it into the code.
- Non-AI split up the project pretty well and so the different parts were able to integrated together smoothly.
- Initial meeting for the non-ai team was really helpful because we were able to split the project into different components.
  - Working on different aspects all together and so it made it easier to finish the project on a better timeline.
- Taking the more complicated project gave us an idea of what problems to look for the process.
- Used Github Issues very well.

#### Weaknesses

- AI made it difficult for people to work on things at the same time because a lot of the project was reliant on other aspects being finished first.
- AI + Non-AI: Having more independent tasks that could be combined later would've made the process faster instead of having two main projects and then splitting the work between the same.
- Hard to collaborate with AI
  - Don't know the prompts of the other people so its a very specific set that has to be followed and its difficult to do so.
    - Makes it more of an individual task than anything else.
- Hard to get used to Javascript and its interaction with HTML within the short period of time.
- Lack of clear communication about the progress of the others and there's less time spent figuring out what to do.
- Documentation should be worked on.
- More rigid/technical tech-spec would be helpful.
  - How information is flowing through the progress.
  - More white-boarding would be good + more regular code check ups.
- Weren't quite ready for the immense scope of the calendar app as a team.

### Focus Moving Forward

- More white-boarding + code check-ups.
- Stricter coding formating guidelines - to help with documentation, etc.
- Incorporate Github Actions into the project in a better way.
