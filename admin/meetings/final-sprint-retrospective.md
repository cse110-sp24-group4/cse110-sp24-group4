### Topics

- Successes and pain points throughout the project
- What can we learn?

## Successes
- We were very efficient with our time and organized with the pull requests.
- Coordinated sections/tasks pretty well.
- Thorough testing &rarr; almost have full code coverage on testing. 
- Good brainstorming
- Everyone voluntarily took up tasks and created issues which allowed for effectiveness and kept the project going.
- Also allowed for people to take up what they wanted to work on.
- People were good about getting their jobs done.
- Pipeline was very strong and helped a lot &rarr; made it easier to not worry too much about breaking things since the testing was really good. 

## Pain points
- Communication between sub-teams could've been better &rarr; knowing what everyone else was doing.
    - Not too much of a surprise since most of us have never done something like this before.
- Could've made more issues &rarr; backlog could've been expanded in some parts.
- Some of the end-to-end testing was a little strange
    - Too heavily linked to some things that we would change and shouldn't impact the end-to-end testing.
- Not laying out requirements enough &rarr; could've spent more time talking about how to implement certain issues.
    - Ex: with the todo list implementation &rarr; could've laid out the specifics of how it should work, interact with the overall project, and then get to work on it.

## What can we learn?
- Everything takes more time than you think it does, and somethings can be more complicated than you initially think.
- Communication between the sub-teams is very important.
- Making large scale projects is much more difficult. When you get more than 3 or 4 people in a group, the coordination between people is really important and difficult.
- Balance is very important &rarr; we all supported each other and made sure none of us fell too far behind.
- Patience and communication is super important and you have to be mindful of other people's work.
- The team's success definitely depends on every individual member's effort.
- How important storming and requirements are before jumping into implementation.
