## SWOT Review

### Strengths:

- Responsiveness
- Portability
- Flexibility
- Intuitive Design
- Simplicity

### Weaknesses:

- Not following Graceful Degredation.
  - Apps are heavily reliant on Javascript and if JS was turned off, the app wouldn't work as well.
- Testing:
  - not confirmed for non-ai application.
  - tested with different browsers + phone for ai group.

### Opportunities

_How can we improve the web app other than on the tech side of the project? Features for the future._

- Turning it into a standalone app
  - **Local focused** -> Using Electron would achieve this.
- Looking back at the user stories to see the different features wanted from there.
  - Location Tagging, Social Media Integration, etc.

### Threats

- Not unique.
- Lack of standalone
- Not as much platform support
- No collaboration feature -> other people can't modify someone else's calendar.
  - Lack of features which would be helpful within the scope of the problem.
