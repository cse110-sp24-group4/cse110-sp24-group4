# Use ESLint to error check

## Problem Statement

How to check our code for errors and warnings regularly?

## Considered Options

- ESLint
- JSLint
- Run locally

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: "ESLint", was used because it is a commonly used standard option. Was simple to set up as a Github Action and that we the team can ensure that the code is regularly checked for simple syntax errors on push.
