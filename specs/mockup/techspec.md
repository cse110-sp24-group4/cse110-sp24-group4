# Tech spec for features due 06/02/2024

This document will detail the expected functioning of features expected to be complete by Sunday 06/02. At this point we will consider our app feature-complete, allowing us 5-7 days for testing and refinement before we turn in our finished product, assuming a due date of June 7th as previously stated or June 9th based on the video we must submit. Sections will represent overarching concepts and their subsections with be linked directly to issues. Feel free to ask clarifying questions from team leads or other team members.

## Refactor Notes elements
Currently the notes elements implemented don't offer much chance to write longer notes without becoming unwieldy. The proposed solution is to refactor the HTML elements to add titles, display the date of the note, and collapse longer notes into previews with the option to expand them. Details on general implementation described below.

>These tasks will likely break our E2E testing so they will need to be tweaked.

### HTML note element refactor

The HTML generated by `notes.js` will need to be refactored. This may include adjusting the IDs of the elements as well as utilizing new HTML elements that better fit the role.

Current structure of note element as of 05/26:
```
<div class="note-block">
    <p class="note-text">Note content</p>
    <button class="note-button"><i class="material-icons">edit</i></button>
    <button class="note-button"><i class="material-icons">delete</i></button>
</div>
```

Proposed new structure:
```
<div id="mockup-project#notes#884" class="note-block">
        <h3 class="note-header">  
            <p class="note-text">Note 2</p>
            <i class="note-date">5/26/2024 10:47:40 AM</i>
        </h3>
        <p class="preview">
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
        </p>
        <details class="note-entry">
            <summary>Expand:</summary>
            <p>
            </p>
        </details>
        <div class="button-container">
        <button class="note-button edit">
            <i class="material-icons">edit</i>
        </button>
        <button class="note-button delete">
            <i class="material-icons">delete</i>
        </button>
    </div>        
</div>
```

`"note-text"` `p` element can be changed to something like `note-title` and the `p` element in the `<details>` tag can become the new `note-text`. Whatever works in the implementation as long as it is consistent. As far as editing functionality goes, we should swap the title out with a text input and the note text out with a text area for editing. These functions can be performed by the same edit button.

The `preview` `p` element should contain the first 100 characters or so, whatever keeps the element a manageable size for the page. The full entry should be stored in the `p` tag under the `details` tag. When the `details` tag is open, the `preview` tag should be set to `display: none;` and returned to visibility once the `details` tag is closed.

### Overall notes page HTML restructure

Some restructure is required in `notes.html` to fit the style. A fully rendered example is present under `specs/mockup/notes.html` along with relevant CSS files.

## Generate new notes for completed todo list items

To make the todo list more useful, we should include an option to mark items as done, then upon clicking a button a user may prompt them to be turned into new notes and removed from the todo list. The todo item would be the title and the user may enter notes in the appropriate section.

>These tasks will likely break our E2E testing so they will need to be tweaked.

## Other items

### UI and Styling
We are still waiting on some mobile renders and CSS styling for project page. The UI renders should be done by the end of this sprint so the pages can be styled accordingly including layout and color. CSS can be tough to work out so feel free to ask for help here.

### Bug fixes
Bug-fixes can always be raised as issues. You can either investigate them yourself or ask other members who may have more knowledge to help as well. The team has been doing well with this.

### General page cleanup
Basic cleanup should be done to clear old text from text boxes and such. As you see these problems feel free to raise an issue about it.

## Time-Permitting features
The following features are nice-to-haves that we listed in our whiteboarding phase. They are not necessary for the app to be considered feature-complete, though if you are looking for something to do you are welcome to experimentally implement them and we can integrate working features in. Due to being half-baked brain-storming ideas there is no specific tech spec for these features. Anyone working on them will have to get one figured out.

### Time-permitting: Gamification
This is a fun idea, though not at all necessary. Something like a dog that hangs out on your project page and completed tasks can be fed to them as treats? Maybe they go through a puppy-to-grown-dog transformation as they are fed. I'm not sure. Feel free to have fun with this.

### Time-permitting: View notes by date
It would be nice to implement the option to view notes by date. This would be another page which we would navigate to based on a calendar input on the projects page. It should list notes and todo list tasks according to the date selected. 

### Time-permitting: Tag and filter notes
We could implement a system of adding tags to notes and then filtering notes based off of that tag. These would be strings stored as properties in the note object and maybe a search bar or drop-down menu at the top of the page to select them. One easy way (though maybe not especially effecient) to implement this is when a tag is selected, we can iterate through the notes and remove any elements that don't contain the tag. Then regenerate the list of notes upon the user removing the filter.
