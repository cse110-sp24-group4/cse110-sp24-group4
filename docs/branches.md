# Branch Documentation

## List of branches

- `main` This serves as the current dev branch for editing the Team Page and is accessable to all members currently. All changes should first be pushed to `main`.
- `publish-branch` This will serve as the branch that GitHub will publish our Team Page from. We will merge with the dev branch when we want to publish changes to the site.
